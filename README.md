# ChatBot
Objective: Create a chatbot that allows the collection of relevant information for the flight booking process using NLP techniques and models.
The three main files used to test the implementation of this chatbot are: dragontravel_chatbot_v3.py, prototype_sound.ipynb, prototype_test.ipynb
The relevant libraries you need before running this prototype are:
'''
  # !pip install spacy
  # !python -m spacy download en_core_web_md
  # !python -m spacy download es_core_news_md
  # !pip install langdetect
  # !pip install dateparser
'''
To run it, run the prototype_test.ipynb file to test a text-only conversation, or prototype_sound.ipynb to test an audio-only conversation.
The main chatbot code is located in the file: dragontravel_chatbot_v3.py
